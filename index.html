        - if we have form fro editing courses, when we submit the form, how we can know which form was editing in the server? each course should has a uniq identifier which is often numeric value, these ides generated by server. when we displaying this form we want to includes id of these course so when we submit the form we can know which course was edited. this is the where we use hidden filed
        
        - we never should use hidden filed for sensitive information because it is accessible through the source code in dev tools. we often use hidden filed for storing id of content being edited.
