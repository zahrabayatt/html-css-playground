/* 
sometimes we want provide different images for different resolutions like tablet, mobile, desktop,... this problem is called resolution switching. 

devices can have same DPR but different resolutions.
for example: Retina Displays
                    |  resolution   |   DPR
    iphone 8            667 x 375        2
    ipad pro 11"       1024 x 768        2 
    MacBook pro 15"    1440 x 900        2 


**if image is going to be show in exact size (width or hight) we don't have any resolution switching problem.
