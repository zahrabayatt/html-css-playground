  Formerly: Data Urls

  Another optimization technique to reduce HTTP requests, this technique embedded images to html document or stylesheets.

  Data url generator: 
  https://www.cssportal.com/image-to-data/

  upload image and copy data url.


  Data url format --> data-portal:image/image-type;data
  **data is a portal which is representative binary file in sequence characters

  with data url we can reduce http request.

  Problems:
