/* 
Physical resolution: which is base on the actual number of pixel on the device Eg. iphone4 960 x 640

Logical resolution: which is how pixel behave on the device Eg. iphone4 480 x 320 (every two physical pixel is present one pixel of image)

Device Pixel Ratio (DPR): physical resolution / logical resolution. Eg. iphone4 = 960 x 640 / 480 x 320 = 2

High Density screen is screen that the DPR of them is grater than one. (DPR > 1)

we can resize our images for different DPRs Eg. 1x, 2x, 3x,... to show images in good quality

to resize image for different DPRs we can use potshot and for resizing always start with large images in other wise we ended up with blur images.
3x = 1200 x 1200 = 4K x 4K
2x = 800 x 800 
x = 400 x 400

** in Jpeg option in potshot set quality to 7.

we can use srcset attribute to set different src for different DPRs.

!!!we only set different source set for images we want to sharp in different DPRs.
