/* In computer we have two types of images: 
   - Raster: which is made up pixel using for phots 
        - come from cameras/scanners
        -Formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, ets
        - Look blurry if scaled up
   - Vector: which define set of math mythical vectors like line, carves for simple graphic, icon, logos
        - created in software(illustrator)
        - Format: SVG
        - Scalable Vector Graphics
        - Look sharp at any size


    RAster images formats: 
         |Colors |  Transparency | Animation
    JPEG    16M       
    GIF     256        #               #
    PNG     16M        #               # 
    WebP    16M        #               #  (smallest size but not support in IE)

    **most of time we use jpeg but if we need animation or transparency, we used pgn, gif, webp
